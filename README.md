# get-rhythm

## Description


We created this app to help users find music by their favorite artists, and see music that's hot that day. Sometimes it can be difficult to find your favorite artists' entire discography in a quick- and easy-to-consume manner.

Users can search for any artist's name and will be presented with the albums in their discography. If the user clicks on any album, they will be able to see songs in the album. If a song is double clicked, the user is presented with a link to the selected song on YouTube. Users can also be linked to an album in Spotify by double clicking on the album. 

Hot Tracks display the top 5 tracks in the US at the time of loading the page. If a user clicks on a hot track, they are presented with a link to view the track's music video on YouTube. If the user double clicks on a hot track, they will be taken to that song in Spotify.
